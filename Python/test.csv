5;5/28/25 14.20.56;5/28/25 14.22.04;anonymous;;;lauren;Look & Drop;4;1;1;3;5;2;"I think the technique needs some getting used to it. Moving, scaling and rotating objects based on gaze feels weird at first. One thing that I noticed is that the anchor point is really important. For example when moving it made a big difference when I chose the corner of the square as the anchor point in comparison the to some point the in middle. Additonally, I think when scaling you should acutally grab the corner of the object. I instinctively looked to where I want the object to end, but since the handles were not on the object itself but outside it did not produce the scale that I would have expected. One last thing is that when rotating it is rather hard to judge the rotation just from the periphery.

I can look anywhere and the interaction only starts when pinching. Moreover, I can look where I can move my object to with the eyes and move it with the hand.
25;5/28/25 16.52.59;5/28/25 16.54.50;anonymous;;;Lars Borchert;Look & Drop;3;5;2;5;5;5;There was a learning curve: I would often not release my pinch in tine and change the selection with my gaze, needing to redo things. I also found I instinctively wanted to move ny head instead of my eyes, which made it tricky. Precise control was difficult but I felt like I could do broad motions well
26;5/28/25 17.00.01;5/28/25 17.01.15;anonymous;;;Lars Borchert;HandRay;4;6;2;5;5;5;I found my pinches were not always registered the way I thought they would be. I also found that after doing the gaze technique, I was used to it and kept trying to control the program with my eyes instead of just my fingers

29;5/29/25 12.31.27;5/29/25 12.33.37;anonymous;;;Kasper Rytter ;Gaze + Pinch;3;3;4;1;3;2;I would say that this technique was the one I got best at both in speed and precision. It was at times a bit difficult to reach the small dots
30;5/29/25 12.33.39;5/29/25 12.35.35;anonymous;;;Kasper Rytter ;HandRay;2;2;4;3;1;4;I think it would be easier, if the speed when expanding the box would be slower 
31;5/29/25 13.45.38;5/29/25 13.47.36;anonymous;;;Jacob Kristensen;Gaze + Pinch;1;1;2;2;2;2;This was the easiest one to use. It felt most intuitive and easy. I liked the combination of gaze and pinch. It was also the easiest one to be precise in, I felt. 
32;5/29/25 13.47.39;5/29/25 13.51.00;anonymous;;;Jacob Kristensen;HandRay;2;2;2;1;2;1;This one felt about as easy as gaze and pinch. This also felt intuitive to me. 
33;5/29/25 13.51.02;5/29/25 13.56.15;anonymous;;;Jacob Kristensen;Look & Drop;3;1;3;2;4;3;This one was the most difficult. Small eye movements produce large changes, especially when rotating objects, which made it more difficult. However, it was easier to do than I expected. I likewise had to give more consideration as to where I put my eyes on the object itself, e.g, in the center, so it would be put where I put my eyes.
