"1,5/27/2025 20:15,5/27/2025 20:16,anonymous,,""good, effortless scaling, rotation and movement. Very smooth working of the program."""
"2,5/27/2025 20:16,5/27/2025 20:16,anonymous,,""In general the application was nice but there were a couple of things that I would improve. For one it is a bit weird that there are buttons that don't do anything. Also, I think that when initially spawning the objects it would be better to drag them in and then rescale them instead of having the scaling from the very start active. The color picker was quite nice."""
"3,5/27/2025 20:16,5/27/2025 20:16,anonymous,,""For the application, i think the visual feedback can be explained more clear in vision. """
4,5/27/2025 20:16,5/27/2025 20:16,anonymous,,The application seems nice intuitive and interactive. 
"5,5/28/2025 10:13,5/28/2025 10:16,anonymous,,""The application has a really nice design, the tutorial is clear, easy to follow, actions needed are intuitive. I also liked the choice of colors and the menu placement. """
"7,5/28/2025 12:20,5/28/2025 12:23,anonymous,,""When drawing a shape, no distinct indication if the tool is selected correctly which was quite misleading. Otherwise, the UI was pretty clean ans easy to understand """
8,5/28/2025 13:17,5/28/2025 13:18,anonymous,,I think the interaction was intuitive. Maybe some sound effects when clicking could be nice. Or something to know when i use eraser or free hand or something.
9,5/28/2025 15:44,5/28/2025 15:45,anonymous,,I think the interaction is quite natural to me. Maybe it's a good idea to show tips sometimes if the user is stuck
10,5/28/2025 17:12,5/28/2025 17:13,anonymous,,It was overall fine. I have little VR experience so I don’t know what is just VR specific and what is the application. But I think one thing the application could improve is an indicator for which tool is currently selected.
"11,5/29/2025 11:53,5/29/2025 11:55,anonymous,,""I think it was great, I have no prior experience with VR, but it was easy and intuitive. The UI is simple and good. I don't know too much about VR so I can't see how it should be improved """
12,5/29/2025 13:26,5/29/2025 13:27,anonymous,,With a little practice it felt intuitive. I would add feedback to “show” that you’ve selected e.g. the objects tab. I didn’t have any problems. With some optimization it would be easily used for more people. 
"13,5/29/2025 16:48,5/29/2025 16:48,anonymous,,""Works well, good ui, understandable"""
"14,5/30/2025 10:28,5/30/2025 10:30,anonymous,,""2D worked great. easy to understand and use. "
"3d was a bit buggy."""
15,5/30/2025 15:34,5/30/2025 15:36,anonymous,,The application was good. It was intuitive and easy to use if calibrated to your hand and eyes. Though it is a bit rough on the wrist and you have to get used to it
"16,6/1/2025 12:14,6/1/2025 12:16,anonymous,,""Overall, it was an interesting experience for someone using VR for the first time, however it was surprisingly easy to use with the guidance of the tutorial, and everything worked nicely."""
